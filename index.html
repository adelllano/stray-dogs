      <p>311 is a non-emergency phone number that people can call in many cities to find information about services, make complaints, or report problems. Recently, this Miami - Dade data set about Stray Dogs was made available to the public. The following data set contains service request activity for Miami-Dade County. The data sets include services completed by Miami-Dade County departments and requests submitted by citizens via phone (311), online (miamidade.gov), and other self service channels such as the 311 Direct mobile application. By definition, Stray Dog Pick-Up means that a person picked up a dog and then animal services came and picked it up from them. We are exploring the “Stray Dog Pick-Up” data in 2017.</p>

      <h2>The Pick-Up Process</h2>
      <h3>Stray Dog At Large vs. Stray Dog Pick Up</h3>
      <p>Stray Dog Pick up means that a person picked up a dog and animal services came and picked it up from them. Once the dogs are picked up, they have an account assigned to them and receive their rabies vaccinations and license. However, it it is important to note that Injured animals inquires take priority over stray dog calls.</p>
      <p>Although not explored in our data sets, another category stray dogs fall under is “Stray Dog at Large.”  The difference is a stray dog at large is a dog someone spots and calls in, the dog is not contained, it could be roaming around. Catching a stray dog can often be a volatile process. Because these animals aren’t tied to a specific residence, they are prone to constant movement and can be difficult to find.</p>

      <p>Stray Dog Count in Miami has seen a notable decline in recent years. In a closer look to how long it takes to place these stray dogs, we’ve found the average amount of placement days per district. District 4 (North Miami) had a significantly longer time placing stray dogs than the other districts, estimating 7.2 days in total. District 10 (Kendall, Westchester, and Fontainebleau) had the shortest turnaround time, averaging at 1.9 days for stray dog placement. While the other districts mostly ranged around the 2 days return period (District 4 and District 6 excluded), the shorter the turnaround time, the better it’ll be for our furry friends.</p>
